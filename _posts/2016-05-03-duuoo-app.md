Duuoo is a one-on-one meeting tool which improves the relationship between managers and team members.

I helped the team build their first app and landing page. Finding ways to optimize the entire process involved in each 1-on-1. From planning meetings, curating talking points, setting agendas, providing insights about employee needs and driving high accountability - so you never lose track and always stay on top of things with your team.

###### Slack and Duuoo works hand in hands, so you can choose who to onboard seamlesssly and don't have to worry about missed communication between co-workers.

###### On Duuoo managers run 1-to-1 (or 1-on-1) with each member of their team. For each 1-to-1 managers get a set of questions wrote by Duuoo team that they can send to employee.

###### Couple days before their 1-to-1, employees and managers can prepare their meeting by reviewing employees'answers.

###### Each 1-to-1 starts with a review of their past 1-to-1 agreements. Once reviewed agreements can be checked off or kept for next review.

###### While seating in the same room or same call, both parties review questions and answers. They can add mutual or individual agreements.
