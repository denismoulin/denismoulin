## It should be as easy working for yourself as being employed

That's how we started to talk about frustrations of Freelancers'life at Founders. Many of us at that time already experienced some time as freelancers and we were stumbling around the same frustrations.

### Figure App

As part of our exploration process, we went through rounds of interviews with freelancers, demos of prototypes around different features/ideas.
Here's a couple of ideas we kept:

- We eliminate the complexity of creating a bank account by connecting to your existing business account (where you get paid)
- We help individuals stay financially afloat by putting aside taxes and VAT money from income
- Business expenses tracking is vital, so let's make it easy.
- Life isn't just work and pay your taxes so we help individuals set some money aside with simple savings.

###### Connecting your business account to Figure

We separate business and personal bank account. Signed up user connects his Business bank account where he receives his freelancer income.

###### Connecting your business account to Figure

A system of actions card help the user get onboarded, setup his automated taxes and VAT or extra savings account.

The dashboard is the principale view on Figure but each "account" (Business/Taxes/Savings) use the same layout and same transactions list so .

Each transaction can be edited and generated automation, as shown below by categorizing this expense at the appropriate VAT business expense, Figure will transfer a positive amount from your VAT account to your Business account.

### Couple months later

Figure app/prototype has generated enough interests to the different stakeholder that we pursued building the first prototype and hand it over to a dedicated who's running it under the name of [Kontist](https://kontist.com/en).
