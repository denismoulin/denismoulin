The app is meant to replace your metasearch on different operating system. Connected to all your favorite apps, Cuely helps you reach your documents, conversations and information quickly.
<br><br>
We planned to brush up Cuely app for marketing launch on various platform. Within a week I broke down the app into components and objects, organize them and style them to have one consistent look and good base for a design system.

I took some time to give his app a bit of personality to stand out.
