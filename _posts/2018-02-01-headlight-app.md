Headlight is a modern coaching solution that enables individuals to define and drive their professional and personal development.

I helped the team to develop concepts and turn them into apps. What you see below is a compilation of simplified key views of the latest app.

###### Your account is unique and could be offered as a perk by your company. Nothing is shared with the rest of your organization.

###### Set up your account and preferences to suit your needs and choose from a range of coaches with different personalities.

###### Sessions are only booked by users but can be rescheduled by either party (user or coach) at any time. Sessions are generally structured around talking points written by coaches.

###### We have scaled down the app from a more complex flow that included goals and agreements tracking, calendar date selection to concentrate our efforts on the session and messaging experience with coaches.
