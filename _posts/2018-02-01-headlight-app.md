Headlight is a modern coaching solution that enables individuals to identify and drive professional and personal development.

I helped the team develop a couple of concept and turn them into apps. What you see below is a compilation of simplified key views of the latest app.

###### Your account is unique and could be offered as a perk by a company. Nothing is shared to the rest of your organization.

###### Setup your account and preferences the way you want. You're also have a choice of different coaches with different personalities.

###### Sessions are only booked by users and can be rescheduled by both parties (users and coaches) at anytime. Each session is usually structured around talking points written by coaches.

###### We have scale down the app away from more complex flow such as streak tracker, calendar date picker, goal tracking on the app and concentrated our effort on the session and messaging experience with coaches.
