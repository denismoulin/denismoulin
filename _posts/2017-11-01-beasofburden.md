While exploring solutions and problems around mental health, I worked with [Toke Barter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tokebarter/) on a more consumer oriented focus approach.

Beast of Burden is an app helping you identify hidden pressures, or any sources of stress/anxiety, and lead you to develop habits to fix them.

You're paired with a Beast, it's your companion or alter-ego that need you to evolve. By picking mini-challenges to explore internal and external pressures affecting your beast, you identify your own pressures.

##### Meet your inner-voice, it'll guide you through the app and your experience

##### Your inner-voice introduces you to your Beast and how to take care of it.

##### After meeting your Beast, you're invited to identify your first pressure and try to balance it via a simple game.

##### You're unbalances and that results in draining your Beast energy. Depending on which pressure you identified, you're assigned a set of actionable insights in form of cards that would improve your Beast mood.

##### Each played card is followed by a feedback on how the actionable insight impacted your Beast mood and you're asked to give your feedback on how it worked for you.

##### In each set of cards is composed of actionable insights but also what we called "Booster". Those Boosters are, low time consuming insights that also improve your Beast mood.

###### Once your Beast's mood is improved enough and it's in calm state, she evolves into a bigger and improved Beast, ready to tackle new challenges with your help.

Beast of Burden was one of my favorite project of 2017, here's a sneak peak of one day of work (<-- sorry) exploring different concepts sand mapping out prototype journey.

Beast of Burden was one of the exploration we took on mental health, Toke is now running the project outside of Founders studio. Our exploration on this topic lead us to start headlight, another project I worked on while at Founders.
