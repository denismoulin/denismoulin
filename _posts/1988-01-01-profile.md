Currently working at [Founders](https://founders.as) as product designer, I help the core team and some of the portfolio companies with their design challenges.
<br><br>
I like to think big, but I'm pragmatic in my day to day work and can take fast decisions on what needs to be done short term.
<br><br>
While interface design is the core of my expertise, experience in front-end development, branding round out my approach. I have experience managing creative processes and stakeholders, self-motivated but able to adapt to different team setups.

Based in {{ site.local }}.
