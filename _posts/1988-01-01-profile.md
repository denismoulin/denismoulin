Currently working with [Founders](https://founders.as) as product designer, I help the core team and some of the portfolio companies with their design challenges.
<br><br>
I like to think big, but Iâ€™m pragmatic in my day-to-day work and can take fast decisions on what needs to be done in the short term.
<br><br>
While interface design is the core of my expertise, experience in front-end development and branding round out my perspective. I have experience managing multi-stakeholder creative processes and am self-motivated but able to adapt to different team structures.
