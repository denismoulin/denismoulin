Duuoo is a one-on-one meeting tool which improves the relationship between managers and team members.

I helped the team build their first app and landing page. Finding ways to optimize the entire process involved in each 1-on-1. From planning meetings, curating talking points, setting agendas, providing insights about employee needs and driving high accountability - so you never lose track and always stay on top of things with your team.
