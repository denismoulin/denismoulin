			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>After earning a degree in graphic design from Ecole Multimedia in Paris,</p>
				<p><b><br>I joined Fred & Farid Paris (300 employees) in 2010.</b></p><br>
				<p class="chapters">I had fun growing there as a designer for two years, shaping brand image and generating interactive user experiences for brands including Martini, Orangina, and Société Générale.<br><a href="#" target="_blank" alt="#" class="sources">Btw here is most of my previous work, mostly advestising/School work.</a></p>
				<p><b><br>In late 2012 I joined Fontyou (15 employees), a Parisian start-up developing online collaborative typography tools.</b></p><br>
				<p class="chapters">I wanted to try a different work environment, learn new tools, try to help in a different way.
				My work there on several fantastic projects around typography and type design community increased my sensitivity to user needs and expectations and broadened my perspective on design. I loved being part of a small team in a fast-paced work environment, and quickly adapted to the Agile methodology that we used.
				My commitment to the project and the tight-knit atmosphere of our team led me to step into the role of product owner for both the platform and new tools, and I appreciated the responsibility and opportunities for growth that this role provided. I also had the opportunity to participate in recruitment, and learned a lot from fielding and developing talent.</p>

				<p>I used my favorite foundry Fontyou <a href="#" target="_blank" alt="#" class="sources">Wes</a> and <a href="#" target="_blank" alt="#" class="sources">Respublika</a>.</p><br>

				<p>I felt that I had more to give to some of my recent work and decided to take the time to finish as best I could. For this reason, some of the work that appears here might differ from what's online now.</p>
